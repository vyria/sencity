Thank you for downloading Scanner! :)

Scanner is a collection of various environment scanning effects in unity3d.
All effects are implemented on GPU, efficient for modern game.

There are 3 kinds of scanning effects, we split the core shaders and scripts into different folders.

Scanner1:
"Demo1" demonstrates a post process based scanning effect.
Play the demo scene, click right mouse on the terrain gameobject. You will see the scanning effect expand along with the terrain surface.
"Demo1" also demonstrates a character follow halo on terrain effect.
Play the demo scene, select and move the sphere. You will see the halo on ground move with it.

Scanner2:
"Demo2-1" and "Demo2-2" demonstrates 5 kinds of object sonar scanning effect.
Select the "Scene" gameobject in hierarchy window, you will see the demo parameters in inspector.
Scan mode SCAN_DIR represents directional scan mode, SCAN_SPH represents spherical scan mode.
Also don't forget try different "Fx Type". 

Scanner3:
"Demo3" demonstrates an intersection highlight effect. After play the demo scene, you will see something like "sci-fi shield" object.
Right side "sphere sci-fi shield" has collision wave effect feature. If you click it you will see wave ripple diffusion on surface.
The click generate ripple diffusion is just a demonstrate usage, for example you can use it to represent a bullet hit shield effect.
Support both perspective and orthographic camera.

Demo scenes demonstrate all features, please refer to it as example usage.
Open it and click play button, Hold left mouse button and move can rotate the camera. Hold W,S,A,D,Q,E key will move the camera.
